        </p>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            <strong>70-100 hour weeks</strong> destroying your health while your
            CEO wonders why you can't "just delegate"
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Passed over for VP/C-suite</strong> because you're seen as

          </li>
          <li>
            Your team operates at <strong>60% capacity</strong> — not because
            they're bad, but because they're waiting on you
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Good engineers are leaving</strong> because working under
            you means being micromanaged (even though that's not your intent)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Technical debt compounds daily</strong> because you're too
            busy firefighting to address it
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Can't take vacation</strong> without everything grinding to
            a halt — and your family notices
          </li>
          <li>
            The board keeps asking
            <strong>"Why does development take so long?"</strong> and you don't
            have a good answer
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Production incidents at 3am</strong> always escalate to you,
            even when your team knows the fix
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>Here's the brutal truth nobody tells CTOs:</p>

      <p>
        <span class="emphasis"
          >Every time you answer a Slack message, solve a problem, or approve a
          decision... you're teaching your team to be dependent on you.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        It's not malicious. You're just <em>really good</em> at solving
        problems. You can debug faster, architect better, and make decisions
        more confidently than most of your team.
      </p>

      <p><strong>So everyone brings their problems to you.</strong></p>

      <p>
        And because you're fast and competent, you solve them. But every time
        you do, you reinforce the pattern: "I need the CTO to make this
        decision."
      </p>

      <p>
        You've created a system where
        <strong>you are the throughput constraint.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The same technical brilliance that got you promoted is now the exact
        thing keeping you trapped. You've optimized yourself into
        irreplaceability — and irreplaceable people don't get promoted to VP.
        They get burned out or replaced by someone who knows how to build
        scalable teams.
      </p>

      <div class="urgency-note">
        ⚠️ Only 5 enrollment spots open this month — if this resonates, enroll

      </div>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>You've Been Refactoring The Wrong Thing</h2>

      <p>
        You understand distributed systems. You know how to build for scale.
        You'd never design software where every request has to go through a
        single server.
      </p>

      <p><strong>So why did you design your team that way?</strong></p>

      <p>
        Imagine running your tech organization like properly architected
        software:
      </p>

      <div class="solution-box">
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Distributed decision-making</strong> — clear authority
            boundaries so teams know what they own
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Autonomous operation</strong> — teams identify problems,
            evaluate solutions, ship code without routing through you
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Built-in redundancy</strong> — the system runs smoothly
            whether you're online or offline
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Self-healing feedback loops</strong> — issues surface and
            get resolved before they become 3am emergencies
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Horizontal scalability</strong> — adding people increases
            throughput instead of creating more dependencies
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p><strong>What would that unlock?</strong></p>

      <ul class="bullet-list">
        <li>Work 40-45 hours per week instead of 80+</li>
        <li>
          Get promoted to VP because you've proven you can scale beyond yourself
        </li>
        <li>Take actual vacations (phone off) without everything imploding</li>
        <li>Address technical debt strategically instead of reactively</li>
        <li>Retain your best engineers because they have real ownership</li>
        <li>Sleep through the night without Slack notifications</li>
        <li>Show up for your family again</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        That's exactly what I help CTOs build with
        <strong>The Decentralized A-Team Method™</strong>.
      </p>

      <div class="divider"></div>

      <h2>I Built This System Because I Was Drowning</h2>

      <p>
        I'm Mike. I was a CTO for 20 years across multiple high-growth
        companies.
      </p>

      <p>
        On paper, I crushed it: Led hundreds of successful projects. Built
        software that resulted in an <strong>$85 million acquisition</strong> —
        the acquiring company bought us specifically for what I architected.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Behind the scenes? I was barely surviving.</strong></p>

      <p>
        100-hour weeks. Every week. For years. Missing my kids growing up. My
        wife drafting divorce papers. Four hours of sleep. Living on caffeine
        and stress.
      </p>

      <p>
        My team wasn't hitting their potential. Projects constantly slipped. I
        was the bottleneck on everything.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every leadership book told me to "delegate more" and "trust my team."
        Useless advice. I <em>was</em> delegating tasks. But I was still the
        single point of failure for every decision.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Then I had my breakthrough.</strong></p>

      <p>
        Driving to another management meeting, half-listening to sports radio
        complaining about the Dodgers' manager Dave Roberts, the host said
        something that stopped me:
      </p>

        "
      >
        "Sure, players need to perform at 100%. But when a talented team
        consistently underperforms, that's not a talent problem — it's a systems
        problem. The manager is responsible for creating the conditions where
        they CAN perform."
      </p>

      <p><strong>Holy shit.</strong></p>

      <p>
        I didn't have a team problem. I had an <em>architecture</em> problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        My team wasn't underperforming because they were incompetent. They were
        underperforming because I had architected a system where every decision
        had to flow through me.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span class="emphasis"
          >I had designed myself as the critical path. The bottleneck was
          ME.</span
        >
      </p>

      <p>
        That day, I started building what became The Decentralized A-Team
        Method. I spent 90 days systematically refactoring my leadership the
        same way I'd refactor code.

      <div class="result-item">
        <strong>Week 3:</strong> My senior engineer deployed a major feature
        without asking for my approval. It worked perfectly. I realized he'd
        been capable of this the whole time — he just needed permission.
      </div>

      <div class="result-item">
        <strong>Week 5:</strong> A production incident happened at 2am. My team
        debugged it, deployed a fix, and documented the postmortem. I found out
        about it the next morning when I read their summary. I didn't lose a
        minute of sleep.

      <div class="result-item">
        <strong>Week 7:</strong> I attended my daughter's piano recital on a
        Tuesday afternoon. My phone stayed in my pocket. Nothing broke.

      <div class="result-item">
        <strong>Week 9:</strong> My CEO pulled me aside: "I don't know what
        you've changed, but the dev team is shipping faster than ever and you
        seem... calmer. Whatever you're doing, keep doing it."
      </div>

      <div class="result-item">
        <strong>Week 12:</strong> My wife and I went on our first vacation in 4
        years. Phone completely off for 7 days. The team didn't just survive —
        they thrived. Two team members later told me it was the first time they
        felt truly trusted.

      <h2>Introducing: The Decentralized A-Team Method™</h2>

      <p class="subhead">
        A complete 8-module course that gives you the exact system to transform
        your team from dependent to autonomous in 90 days —
        <strong>built specifically for CTOs who think in systems</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This isn't "leadership 101" from a business school professor who's never
        deployed code.
      </p>

      <p>
        This isn't "delegate more" platitudes that ignore the reality of
        technical complexity.

      <p>
        <strong

          same thinking you apply to software architecture.</strong

      <h3>The Core: The P.A.C.E. Framework</h3>

      <p>
        The transformation happens through four integrated components that work
        together like microservices:

            P — Purposeful Alignment
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The Problem:</strong> Your team asks "Should we do X or Y?"
            because they don't have a decision framework.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 8px">
            <strong>The Fix:</strong> Define your North Star Purpose and build
            decision filters. Your team learns to evaluate options autonomously
            instead of escalating every choice to you.

            you're unavailable, everything stops.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 8px">
            <strong>The Fix:</strong> Build communication cadences and feedback
            loops that work without you. Create peer-to-peer channels that
            surface problems early and enable self-correction.

          <p style="margin-top: 8px">
            <strong>The Fix:</strong> Redefine roles by outcomes, not job
            titles. Build visibility that tracks ownership, not activity. Make

            consequences.

            <strong>The Problem:</strong> Your CEO doesn't understand your
            roadmap. Your team doesn't understand business priorities. You're
            constantly translating.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top: 8px">
            <strong>The Fix:</strong> Implement top-down clarity (business →
            tech) and bottom-up reporting (tech → business value). Use the DCAT
            Meeting Stack to cut meeting time 60% while improving alignment.
          </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>When these four components integrate:</strong> Your team stops
        waiting for you to tell them what to do... and starts operating like
        they own the outcomes.

        <div class="faq-q">
          Q: How can you guarantee I'll cut my hours in half?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          <p>
            Because you're currently the bottleneck. When we distribute
            decision-making authority and remove you as the single point of
            failure, the math works.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've done this with dozens of CTOs. Average result: 40-55% hour
            reduction. If you implement the system and you're coachable, your
            hours will drop. If they don't, you get refunded.
          </p>

      <div class="faq">
        <div class="faq-q">Q: What if my team isn't capable of autonomy?</div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          <p>
            Here's what I've learned in 20 years:
            <strong
              >Most "incapable teams" are capable teams trapped in dependency
              architecture.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            When your team constantly escalates to you, that's not incompetence
            — you've systematically trained them that you are the source of all
            decisions. It's actually rational behavior in the system you've
            built.
          </p>
          <p>
            We fix the system (decision frameworks, accountability structures,
            communication rhythms), and suddenly your "C-players" start making
            great decisions. It's not magic — it's architecture.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq">
        <div class="faq-q">
          Q: I already delegate tasks. Why isn't that enough?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          <p>Because task delegation ≠ decision delegation.</p>
          <p>
            You're delegating the "what" but not the "why" or "how to decide."
            So your team executes tasks but still routes every decision through
            you. You're still the critical path.
          </p>
          <p>
            This course teaches you how to delegate <em>authority</em>, not just
            work. That's when you stop being the bottleneck.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq">
        <div class="faq-q">
          Q: Why don't you have more testimonials/case studies?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          <p>
            Most clients require strict confidentiality. Sitting CTOs can't
            publicly admit they're working on leadership challenges — it affects
            board perception, professional reputation, and future opportunities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The testimonials I share come from clients who've moved to new roles
            or founded their own companies and are comfortable going public.
          </p>
          <p>
            But here's my proof: <strong>Money-back guarantee.</strong> If you
            implement the system and don't get results, you get refunded. I'm
            putting my money where my mouth is.

            Implementation work is 2-4 hours per week as you build your
            frameworks and apply them with your team.
          </p>
          <p>Total: 3-5 hours per week for 12 weeks.</p>
          <p>
            That 3-5 hours is an investment that returns 20-40 hours per week
            once the system is running. Best ROI you'll ever get.

          Q: What makes this different from generic leadership training?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-a">
          <p>
            Generic leadership training is built for corporate managers. It's
            full of platitudes that don't translate to leading technical teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>This is built specifically for CTOs by a CTO.</strong> I
            speak your language. I understand:
          </p>
          <ul class="bullet-list">
            <li>Production incidents that always escalate to you at 3am</li>
            <li>
              Non-technical executives who don't understand why things take time
            </li>
            <li>The technical debt vs. velocity tradeoff</li>
            <li>
              Managing brilliant engineers who can build anything but struggle
              with ownership
            </li>
            <li>Board pressure to "move faster with less"</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This isn't theory — it's the exact system I used to cut my own hours
            in half while my team's performance increased 400%.

      <h2>Here's Your Choice:</h2>

      <p>
        <strong>Path A:</strong> Keep being the hero. Keep working 80-hour
        weeks. Keep hoping your team will magically become more independent.
        (They won't — you've trained them otherwise.)
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Path B:</strong> Invest $2,997 in systematically refactoring
        your leadership architecture. Build a team that scales without you. Get
        your life back.

        <strong>P.S.</strong> — Remember: You're protected by the money-back
        guarantee. You either transform your team and reclaim your life, or you
        get refunded. The only real risk is staying stuck in 80-hour weeks for
        another year.
